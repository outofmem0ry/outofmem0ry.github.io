## Exploring Naomi's persona

This article will help you in [understanding the personas of Alana, Cody and Naomi within Pivotal Container Service (PKS)](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/understanding-the-personas-of-alana-cody-and-naomi-within-pivotal-container-service-pks).

- **Operations performed by Alana or Cody**
  
  - Target PKS API

    ```shell
    uaac target pks-$LABNUM.$DOMAIN:8443 --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate

    Unknown key: Max-Age = 86400
    Target: https://pks-$LABNUM.$DOMAIN:8443
    ```

  - Login as admin

    ```shell
    uaac token client get admin -s z1sVCS3FWgq54nrXthh50lg_MZjGXOEb

    Unknown key: Max-Age = 86400
    Successfully fetched token via client credentials grant.
    Target: https://pks-$LABNUM.$DOMAIN:8443
    Context: admin, from client admin
    ```

  - Add user Naomi to UAA internal database

    ```shell
    uaac user add naomi --emails naomi@example.com -p changeme
    ```

  - Create naomi role object. These permissions are too wide open. This can be adjusted accordingly by Alana based on the user requirements.

    ```shell
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      namespace: default
      name: naomi
    rules:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      resources: ["*"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    ```
  
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f naomi-role.yml
    role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/naomi created

    kubectl get roles
    NAME    AGE
    naomi   5s
    ```

  - Create RoleBindings for naomi

    ```shell
    kind: RoleBinding
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: naomirolebinding
      namespace: default
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: naomi
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: naomi
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

  - Apply rolebinding

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f naomi-rb.yml
    rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/naomirolebinding created
    ```

- **How Naomi gets her `kubeconfig` ?** ü§î
  - The below command will write Naomi's kubeconfig to a file named `naomi_kubeconfig` in the current directory

    ```shell
    #Use Naomi's password

    KUBECONFIG=naomi_kubeconfig ./pks get-kubeconfig firstcluster -u naomi -a pks-$LABNUM.$DOMAIN --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```

- Testing Naomi's access
  - Try to deploy workload in kube-system namespace. Denied üö´üö´üö´üö´. Remember we only gave her privileges to deploy in default namespace

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml -n kube-system --kubeconfig=naomi_kubeconfig
  
    Error from server (Forbidden): error when retrieving current configuration of:
    Resource: "/v1, Resource=pods", GroupVersionKind: "/v1, Kind=Pod"
    Name: "nginx", Namespace: "kube-system"
    Object: &{map["metadata":map["labels":map["name":"nginx"] "name":"nginx"     "namespace":"kube-system" "annotations":map["kubectl.kubernetes.io/  last-applied-configuration":""]  ] "spec":map["containers":[map["image":"nginx" "name":"nginx"   "ports":[map["containerPort":'P']]]]  ] "apiVersion":"v1" "kind":"Pod"]}
    from server for: "nginx.yaml": pods "nginx" is forbidden: User "naomi" cannot get resource   "pods"   in API group "" in the namespace "kube-system"
    ```

  - Let's try the default namespace.

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml --kubeconfig=naomi_kubeconfig
    pod/nginx created
    ```
  
## Deploying a containerized static github website

We'll deploying the static website that is being used for this workshop. High level overview of what we are going to do

- Get the app source code for the static web app ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Package the app into a docker image üì¶
- Run the image locally on your machine üê≥
- Push the image to docker hub ‚è´
- Deploy the app to the cluster ‚ò∏Ô∏è
- Expose your app üîÆ

### Step 1: Getting the application source code ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The source code for this app is available [here](https://github.com/outofmem0ry/outofmem0ry.github.io.git)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/outofmem0ry/outofmem0ry.github.io.git
```

### Step 2: Building a container image üì¶

- To package this app we need the source code and a Dockerfile. Thet both are available in the repo we cloned in the last step.

  ```shell
  cd outofmem0ry.github.io/
  ```

- In the first terminal, set an environment variable for your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) user name. It can be the same [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) user name that you used to log in to the terminals on this site.

  ```shell
  export USERNAME=YourUserName
  ```

- Make sure you're still in the `outofmem0ry.github.io` directory.

  ```shell
  pwd
  ```

- Login to your docker hub account using `docker login` 
- Build and tag the docker image
  
  ```shell
  docker build . -t $USERNAME/pks_workshop
  ```

- The image should be present locally now. You can check using `docker images`

### Step 3: Run the image on your local machine

- Before deploying this application on our cluster let's try to deploy this application on our local machine.

  ```shell
  docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --name $USERNAME $USERNAME/pks_workshop
  ```

- Browse the app at `localhost:4000`

### Step 4: Push the image to docker hub

```shell
docker push $USERNAME/pks_workshop
```

### Step 5: Deploy the app to the cluster

```shell
kubectl run $USERNAME --image=$USERNAME/pks_workshop
```

### Step 6: Expose your deployment

```shell
kubectl expose deployment $USERNAME \
--type=NodePort \
--port=4000 \
--target-port=4000
```

## Accessing the web app

- After the deployment is exposed it creates a service. You can view this service using
  
  ```shell
  kubectl describe svc $USERNAME
  ```

- The web app can be accessed using a combination of your worker node IPs and node port from the `kubectl describe` output
  
  ```shell
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

- Open `workerNodeIP:NodePort` in your browsers
